# Neolab and Myscript Integration

This Android app contains Integration Codes for both the Neo Lab SDK and the MyScript Interactive Ink SDK

##.NeoLab
The Neolab SDK is a software created for use with the NeoSmartPen a digital pen used to collect data written on paper that contains the Special Ncode Pattern
The SDK which is available for not only android but other platforms too carries out the communication with the Pen in obtaining data (in form of strokes) gotten from the Pen

### MyScript
The MyScript Interactive Ink SDK is an SDK that performs Interpretation of digital ink, most times in form of strokes that contains pointer to digital text.
So the myscript SDK takes in a set of strokes and through their algorithms, it outputs in digital text what a user wrote, Its Interpretation accuracty is Top Notch

### Our App
Our app here uses both Libraries, the app is a data collection app that connects with the NeoSmart Pen and collects Stoke Data with the Help of the NeoLab SDK and then interprets it to digital text using Myscript's SDK.
